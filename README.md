# Personal Website
Having dealt with mainly back-end programming languages throughout my life, I decided that it was a good idea to learn something about 
basic front-end web development.  

Prior to this project, I only had around 2 week of learning experience with HTML5/CSS3 in the summer of 2018. After brushing up on some 
of my techniques, I am now confidently able to create a website using basic HTML5/CSS3 and incorporate JavaScript code, including the use 
of Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.
